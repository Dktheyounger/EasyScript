# EasyScript

#The idea although not yet created is to have a library that could be used to easily alow users of a c# application to write c# code that will be used by the application.

#Good example might be a game engine.
#Also could see it being used by some larger companies even if they did not want there users to create the scripts could be powerfull with LLMs at some point allow for some powerfull automation potentially.

#Ideally will keep it low in code and fast as possbile so that it will be stable, reliable and fast.

#Implementations specifics are still in the works.

#Documentation will come after implemention.
